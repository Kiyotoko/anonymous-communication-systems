  abstract  = {A mixnet is a multi-stage system that accepts encrypted messages as its input and generates a new altered output while exploiting cryptographic operations and repeated permutations to ensure the untraceability between the input and the output messages. Based on the employed cryptographic operations, the main types of mixnets and their variants are: decryption, re-encryption, universal re-encryption and hybrid mixnets. Mixnets offer a degree of anonymity on the Internet by making communications untraceable. Nazmul Islam, Kazi Md Rokibul Alam and Ashiqur Rahman of Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh explain the various kinds of mixnet commonly deployed, and carry out tests to see how they perform. Using the experimental data, they compare the various types to see which offers the best results.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel way to implement a fingerprinting attack against Onion Routing anonymity systems such as Tor. Our attack is a realistic threat in the sense that it can be mounted by a single controller of entrance routers and furthermore require very few resources. The conventional fingerprinting attack based on incoming traffic does not work straightforwardly against Tor due to its multiplex and quantized nature of traffic. By contrast, our novel attack can degrade Tor's anonymity by a metric based on both incoming and outgoing packets. In addition, our method keeps the fingerprinting attack's advantage of being realistic in terms of the few required resources. Regarding evaluation, the effectiveness of our method is discussed in a comprehensive manner: experimentally and theoretically. In order to enhance further studies and show the significance of our idea, we also discuss methods for defending against our attack and other applications of our idea.},

This confusion has resulted in a situation where the popular trade press, industry pundits, and vendors and consumers of networking technologies alike, generally use the term “VPN” as an offhand reference for a set of different technologies. This paper attempts to provide a common sense definition of a VPN, and an overview of different approaches to building them.},

  abstract  = {Internet users increasingly rely on commercial virtual private network (VPN) services to protect their security and privacy. The VPN services route the client's traffic over an encrypted tunnel to a VPN gateway in the cloud. Thus, they hide the client's real IP address from online services, and they also shield the user's connections from perceived threats in the access networks. In this paper, we study the security of such commercial VPN services. The focus is on how the client applications set up VPN tunnels, and how the service providers instruct users to configure generic client software. We analyze common VPN protocols and implementations on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. We find that the VPN clients have various configuration flaws, which an attacker can exploit to strip off traffic encryption or to bypass authentication of the VPN gateway. In some cases, the attacker can also steal the VPN user's username and password. We suggest ways to mitigate each of the discovered vulnerabilities.},
